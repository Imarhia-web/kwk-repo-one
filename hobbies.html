            <p1> Most of my hobbies are either creative or really athletic. 
                I love team sports and arts and crafts. My current hobbies
                are volleyball and ice skating with the occasional time for sketching,
                painting and knitting. </p1>

            I really love a hands on creative activity that allows me to turn my brain off,
             those make me feel most like a kid.

                One of my favourite quotes I think of when I decide to invest 
                energy into something is from an all time favourite children's book.
                "All grown-ups were once children, but only few of them remember it"
                 - The Little Prince.
